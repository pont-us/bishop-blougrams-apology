# Bishop Blougram’s Apology

I wanted to read Robert Browning’s long poem ‘Bishop Blougram’s Apology’.
While there is a public domain text of it available, I wasn’t very
pleased with the formatting. I therefore produced this HTML version
with better typography, hyperlinked footnotes, and some typos corrected.

As well as the HTML source, the repository includes a script which uses
Calibre's `ebook-convert` utility to convert the HTML to mobi and epub
versions, and pregenerated versions in those formats.

The source text is in the public domain, and this version is also released
into the public domain (CC0 license).
